# Media Meets Semantic Web

## Definitions

- Semantic Web:
- BBC:
- Linked Data:
- DBpedia:
- MusicBrainz

## Problem

- Large amounts of online content: text, audio, video
- Historically separated into domain specific microsites (food, gardening, sport, etc) _[screenshot]_
- Not possible to...
    - Find everything, BBC has published to a given subject
    - navigate between BBC domains following a semantic thread

## Objectives

- Better connections and interlinking of existing systems
- Soft transition and reducing impact on existing systems while adding new services to maximize interlinking of domains

1. Develop a service to link all radio and TV programmes with all other data sources in the Linked Data cloud
2. Develop a new music offering
3. Retrofit simple navigational elements (i.e. topic badges)
4. Provide a common set of web sale identifiers to help create equivalency between multiple vocabularies

## Cross-Linking / Interlinking

- Legacy auto-categorization system: CIS
    - categorize programmes by textual description (brands, locations, people, subjects)
    - can be used to interlink between different domains while developing them independently
    - -> if there are mappings between the various vocabularies
    - difficult to cover every single entity that might be of interest
    - no relations between terms are available
    - only internal identifiers, no linking to non-BBC data

- need for a common set of web identifiers: DBpedia!
- DBpedia becomes vocabulary to connect all BBC domains
